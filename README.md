[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-BSD-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

TensorFlow-HRT is a project that is maintained by **OPEN** AI LAB, it uses heterogeneous computing infrastructure framework to speed up [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org) and provide utilities to debug, profile and tune application performance. 

The release version is 0.0.1, is based on [Rockchip RK3399](http://www.rock-chips.com/plus/3399.html) Platform, target OS is Ubuntu 16.04. Can download the source code from [OAID/TensorFlow-HRT](https://github.com/OAID/TensorFlow-HRT)

* The ARM Computer Vision and Machine Learning library is a set of functions optimised for both ARM CPUs and GPUs using SIMD technologies. See also [Arm Compute Library](https://github.com/ARM-software/ComputeLibrary).
* Tensorflow is a fast open framework for deep learning. See also [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).

### Arm Compute Library Compatibility Issues :
There are some compatibility issues between ACL and Tensorflow ops. 
* Tensorflow default data format is NHWC and HWIO, but ACL only supports NCHW and OIHW. 
  In order to test TensorFlow-HRT, macro TEST_ACL is used to enable convert data format between ACL and TF at compiling.
* ACL does not support some pooling ops, such as AvgPooling with 3x3 kernel, 1x1 stride and SAME padding.
* ACL does not support some CONV ops, such as testConv2DKernelSmallerThanStrideSame, testConv2D2x2FilterStride2Same, ...
* When using ACL C++ multi-thread, TF often hang. A workaround is to set ACL scheduler using ST mode.
* ACL buffer round is different with TF. Both ACL round CEIL and round FLOOR are tried to get the same buffer size as TF.
  If both fail, an exception is thrown. 
* Input/output/weight shape may be changed at inference. The shapes of all inputs must be checked before run ACL OP. 

Performance is not good. In the future, TensorFlow-HRT needs to skip ACL runtime layer 
 or only uses ACL very low layer APIs.

**TensorFlow** is an open source software library for numerical computation using
data flow graphs.  The graph nodes represent mathematical operations, while
the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) that flow
between them.  This flexible architecture lets you deploy computation to one
or more CPUs or GPUs in a desktop, server, or mobile device without rewriting
code.  TensorFlow also includes TensorBoard, a data visualization toolkit.

TensorFlow was originally developed by researchers and engineers
working on the Google Brain team within Google's Machine Intelligence Research
organization for the purposes of conducting machine learning and deep neural
networks research.  The system is general enough to be applicable in a wide
variety of other domains, as well.

## Installation
*See [Installing TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/os_setup.html) for instructions on how to install our release binaries or how to build from source.*

People who are a little more adventurous can also try our nightly binaries:

**Nightly pip packages**
* We are pleased to announce that TensorFlow now offers nightly pip packages
under the [tf-nightly](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tf-nightly) and
[tf-nightly-gpu](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tf-nightly-gpu) project on pypi.
Simply run `pip install tf-nightly` or `pip install tf-nightly-gpu` in a clean
environment to install the nightly TensorFlow build. We support CPU and GPU
packages on Linux, Mac, and Windows.
